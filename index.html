        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This DIY digital synthesizer and drum set project is perfect for any music enthusiast, 
            hacker, or programmers who are interested in digital signal processing (DSP), modern music production, electronics and programming.
            Use an Arduino and Rasperry PI Pico (optional) to create your own DJ deck, complete with a synthesizer, effects (attack, delay, sustain, release)
            , keyboard and drums. Develop some applied practical skills and add your own twists following along with this project!
        </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The main goal of this project was to utilize an analogue 
            component with an embedded component to create a system that 
            functionally produces and processes audio signals for musical applications. 
            Our system integrates the envelope components of the synthesizer 
            with the touch pads of the drum set to create a model of a DJ set that 
            allows for real-time sound creation and manipulation. This project 
            demonstrates the use of practical applications in circuit design as well
             as developing and processing audio signals for output, combining analog 
             signal conditioning with digital control systems.</p>

    <section class="Lesson 1: Play around with sound.">
        <h2>Lesson 1: Play around with sound.</h2>
        <p>Originally we set out to make a vocoder for this project, but after much testing and consideration we decided to 
            pivot. Some of the elements we built however, remained useful. The first thing we built was an audio power amplifier, 
            so that we could experiment with playing different sounds through it, and how different filters would affect the audio.
            You can try connecting the <strong>green wire</strong> to different types of input and playing with the volume controls.

            </object>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>LM386 IC:</strong> This integrated circuit amplifies the weak audio signal to a level that can drive a speaker.</li>
                
                <li><strong>500kΩ Potentiometer:</strong> This serves as our volume control, allowing us to adjust the amount of audio signal that reaches the amplifier. Turning this knob adjusts the amplitude of the output sound.</li>
                
                <li><strong>0.33μF Capacitor (Input):</strong> This capacitor blocks DC voltage while allowing AC audio signals to pass through, preventing DC offset from affecting the amplifier.</li>
                
                <li><strong>220μF Capacitor (Output):</strong> This large electrolytic capacitor couples the amplified audio signal to the speaker while blocking DC current.</li>
                
                <li><strong>8Ω Speaker:</strong> The final component in our chain converts the electrical signal from the amplifier into sound waves we can hear. The 8Ω impedance matches well with the LM386's output characteristics.</li>
            </ul>
            To experiment with the power amp, you can connect the input of the circuit to a PWM pin on an Arduino and use the "tone.h" library to play different frequencies.

    <section class="Lesson 4: Create a GUI.">
        <h2>Lesson 4: Create a GUI.</h2>
        <p>
            The graphical user interface (GUI) serves a few functions. Firstly, it displays the current properties set on the ADSR for tuning.
            It also functions as an oscilloscope, and can display the wave that is being generated by the keyboard synthesizer.
            By using the click functionality on the joystick, a user can select from a list of preprogrammed drum loops, which will start playing on the drum via the Pico!
            Navigation through the GUI works with the flick of the joystick, by flicking left or right, you can cycle through the different screens.
            By flicking up and down, you can cycle through the different preprogrammed drum loops and songs.
            <object type="image/svg+xml" data="interactive_elems/synth_GUI_bb.svg" class="project-image">
                Your browser does not support SVG
            </object>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arduino:</strong> The Arduino Uno controlls the GUI states, sends state updates to the Pico and refreshes the OLED display. This could be run on the same Arduino as the synthesizer or even on the Pico. We did experiment with running the GUI on the second core of the Pico, but because of a lack of analogue input GPIO pins, and no library support for the Adafruit OLED displays, this did not work. It would have been simple to also run the GUI on the Arduino Nano, where the synthesizer runs, however, again because of a limit on GPIO pins and clock constraints (the Nano was not fast enough to get sufficient wave resolution and run the GUI) this was abandoned. If we were to do this project again, we would use just one microcontroller with more computational power to run the synthesizer and the GUI. </li>
                
                <li><strong>Joystick:</strong> The joystick is used to navigate the GUI through three analogue inputs: displacement in x, displacement in y, and clicking of the joystick. In the code there are limits defined for what displacement of the joystick is considered a 'flick'. These flicks are used to navigate through the different menus and also between songs/drum loops within menus. When a user wants to select a song, they can click in on the joystick. This click is debounced, and depending on the state of the screen (which drum loop/song they were hovering over), the selected drum loop/song will be updated. Every time a selection is updated this is passed to the Pico.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Output wires:</strong> The white, orange, ochre, and purple wires in the schematic (connected to digital GPIO pins) are the functinonal connections to the Pico. They relay the update drum/song choice to the Pico. In our implementation, this works simply but outputting a 'high' to a wire corresponding to each possible drum selection. In the future, it would be better to serialize the selection.</li>
                
                <li><strong>OLED display:</strong> The OlED display runs on the Adafruit SSD1306 library over serial peripheral interface (SPI). There is great support of this screen on the Arduino, using the SPI library and the Adafruit screen library. Using the built in functions of these libraries, custom screens can be drawn and displayed on the screen based on state variables. This is the main premise of the code implementation, discussed below.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <div class="code-container">
                <div class="code-header">
                    <span>Arduino Code for GUI</span>
                    <span class="code-language">C++</span>
                </div>
                <pre><code id="gui-arduino-code" class="language-cpp" data-src="code_snippets/gui_arduino_code.ino"></code></pre>
            </div>
            At it's core the GUI is driven by one state variable: <strong>screen_state</strong>, which ranges from 1-5, and denotes the current screen that will be displayed: a main menu, synthesizer controls, oscilloscope, song selector, and drum selector. The chooseScreen() function continuously reads the joystick's X-axis: pushing right increments screen_state, pushing left decrements it, and it wraps around when it goes beyond either end. Each loop iteration then calls drawScreen(), which dispatches to the appropriate drawing function for the current mode.
            For selecting and playing preprogrammed drum loops (screen_state == 5), the joystick's Y-axis moves a highlighted box through up to four entries ("Money beat", "Hip-Hop", "Funk", "None"), while a click of the joystick button(debounced) commits a choice into selected_song. The selected song is conveyed to the Pico, to play the drums.
            Throughout the code, "dead-zone" thresholds prevent jitter when the joystick is centered, and brief delay(100) calls debounce menu transitions.
